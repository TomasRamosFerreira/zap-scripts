# OWASP ZAP Custom Scripts Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of custom scripts developed for OWASP ZAP, designed to facilitate and automate various security testing tasks. These scripts enhance the functionality of OWASP ZAP, allowing efficient and comprehensive penetration testing of complex applications, especially those with authentication mechanisms not directly supported by default.

Scripts are primarily developed in **JavaScript** due to extensive community support and compatibility with the GraalVM engine in OWASP ZAP.
